People spend about 5 hours a week looking at themselves in the mirror. This is, for most of us, time we spend with ourselves: recapitulating the events of the day, getting ourselves ready to go out or simply admiring our reflection. But to others, this is not so easy.
Studies show that 2 in 5 people always feel dissatisfied with themselves when they look in the mirror. These people would avoid a mirror at all costs and do not enjoy the “me time” that the rest of us do. The same study also states that out of the 40% of people that dodge their reflection, most of them are women.

I am sure that at some point, we all felt agitated to correspond to other’s expectations and to fit into our social group. That constant looking in the mirror and questioning our appearance is stressful. Sometimes we walk out of our house thinking that we look terrible.

Women at menopause are very susceptible to the feeling of disappointment when looking in the mirror. Studies show that women can gain between 1 to 2 kilograms during perimenopause (though many gain more). This together with a potential increase in emotional instability can cause women to despise themselves, avoiding their reflection at all costs.

What is even more alarming is that 1 in 8 adults has suicidal thoughts inflicted by their body image. Looking in the mirror for these people is dreadful, but what if we convince them that life goes beyond what they look like, that it does not matter how your hair looks, that everyone is beautiful in their own way.

This is SmileMirror. I decided to simplify my approach to this problem and thought about what people would want to hear when they look in the mirror. “You can do it” or “Keep going” perhaps. I thought of it like when you learn on Duolingo, and every time you get 5 or 10 answers right in a row, Duo pops up and felicitates you. Although I am aware that Duo is an animated bird, I do feel proud of myself when I am complimented.

What if we could bring this positive feedback to a mirror? This is what SmileMirror aims to do. The application consists of an AI driven smart camera placed on the mirror providing on the edge facial recognition. When the person spends time in front of the mirror, the device detects this and sends them a notification on their phone with an inspirational message to keep them going through the day.

Although simple, this application can truly boost one’s impression of themselves as well as making them feel appreciated. Let’s make looking in the mirror enjoyably for everyone!

## What is SmileMirror?
SmileMirror consists of an AI empowered smart camera mounted on the user’s mirror. This camera has a facial recognition module on edge meaning that no image data is sent outside the camera. The camera is paired with an Arduino microcontroller which checks if the camera detected a face.

If a face is detected for 2 minutes, the device will choose an inspirational message stored locally and send it to the user via a mobile notification powered by the Blynk backend. The device will then wait until the person is not in the mirror anymore and will then start the loop again.

One compliment at a time, SmileMirror can work to the benefit of the user.
